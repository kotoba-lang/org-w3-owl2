  "Structural validation for owl.model ontologies, returning
  kotoba.dsl.problem-shaped problems (:owl/severity :error|:warn).

  :error means the ontology is not structurally well-formed OWL 2 (a
  reference with no matching Declaration when there are no imports to
  explain it away, an n-ary axiom below its spec-mandated minimum arity, a
  class/property listed twice in its own Disjoint* axiom, a negative
  cardinality, or a directly-detectable contradiction such as an individual
  asserted into two classes that are also asserted mutually disjoint).
  :warn flags things that are legal OWL 2 but only ambiguously checkable
  without resolving imports (an undeclared reference when the ontology DOES
  import other ontologies -- the entity might be declared there).

  This is NOT a description-logic reasoner (see owl.reason and the README):
  every check here is a plain structural walk over the asserted axioms, not
  general OWL 2 DL consistency checking, so a `valid?` ontology can still be
  DL-inconsistent in ways this namespace cannot see (e.g. contradictions
  that only show up after existential/cardinality reasoning)."
